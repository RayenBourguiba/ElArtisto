										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One minute you’re battling traffic on LA’s 405 Freeway in your <strong>1990s Honda Civic</strong>, the next you’re sitting in a 16th-century farmhouse in the&nbsp;English&nbsp;countryside deciding between goose and braised brisket for dinner. A change of scenery can be a beautiful thing.</p>



<p>I’ve travelled more than <strong>5,000 miles</strong> for this farmhouse, now a boutique hotel with six rooms, called Artist Residence Oxfordshire.&nbsp;Since opening its doors, the property has landed on The Times ‘<em>100 best British hotels</em>’ list, been lauded by The Independent for ‘making the countryside a little more louche’ and nabbed a nomination for Best-Dressed Hotel in the Mr &amp; Mrs <a href="#">Smith Hotel Awards</a>. Word travels fast – across- continents fast.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://themezinho.net/wandau/images/recent-news02.jpg" alt="Image"/></figure>



<p>The final straws on the property’s thatched roof had only been in place a second before friends from London to Los Angeles returned with rave reviews. One pal, a&nbsp;Hollywood casting agent, rhapsodised over the hotel’s attention to detail, ‘right down to the embroidered hair dryer and slipper bags.’ A Brooklyn-based couple – <strong>both photographers</strong> – messaged me that it’s ‘the quirky country retreat of their dreams’ and they’d move there if only they knew something about raising chickens. Louche, quirky, chickens – I was sold.</p>



<p>Artist Residence Oxfordshire is in a rural village called South Leigh (population: 336), on the edge of the Cotswolds. The place is perhaps most famous for eccentric former local,&nbsp;<strong>Gerry Stonhill</strong>, who took on Tony Blair’s smoking ban a decade ago and defiantly paid a citation entirely in coppers (more on him later). Though the area feels remote, it’s incredibly easy to access from London. I hop on a train from Paddington, which takes an hour to get to Hanborough. From there it’s a 10-minute cab ride before I pull into the hotel’s gravel drive. A pair of petite penguin statues greet me and I spot a door with an embossed metal sign reading: ‘<em>NO RIFF RAFF</em>’. It appears they’ve been forewarned.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“ The whole Mr Hanbury thing is just weird enough to work. And maybe it’s this elaborate storytelling that makes other creatives feel at home. ”</p></blockquote>
