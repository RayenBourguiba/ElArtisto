A change of scenery can be a beautiful thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve travelled more than <strong>5,000 miles<\/strong> for this farmhouse, now a boutique hotel with six rooms, called Artist Residence Oxfordshire.\u00a0Since opening its doors, the property has landed on The Times \u2018<em>100 best British hotels<\/em>\u2019 list, been lauded by The Independent for \u2018making the countryside a little more louche\u2019 and nabbed a nomination for Best-Dressed Hotel in the Mr &amp; Mrs <a href=\"#\">Smith Hotel Awards<\/a>. Word travels fast \u2013 across- continents fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/themezinho.net\/wandau\/images\/recent-news02.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The final straws on the property\u2019s thatched roof had only been in place a second before friends from London to Los Angeles returned with rave reviews. One pal, a\u00a0Hollywood casting agent, rhapsodised over the hotel\u2019s attention to detail, \u2018right down to the embroidered hair dryer and slipper bags.\u2019 A Brooklyn-based couple \u2013 <strong>both photographers<\/strong> \u2013 messaged me that it\u2019s \u2018the quirky country retreat of their dreams\u2019 and they\u2019d move there if only they knew something about raising chickens. Louche, quirky, chickens \u2013 I was sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artist Residence Oxfordshire is in a rural village called South Leigh (population: 336), on the edge of the Cotswolds. The place is perhaps most famous for eccentric former local,\u00a0<strong>Gerry Stonhill<\/strong>, who took on Tony Blair\u2019s smoking ban a decade ago and defiantly paid a citation entirely in coppers (more on him later). Though the area feels remote, it\u2019s incredibly easy to access from London. I hop on a train from Paddington, which takes an hour to get to Hanborough. From there it\u2019s a 10-minute cab ride before I pull into the hotel\u2019s gravel drive. A pair of petite penguin statues greet me and I spot a door with an embossed metal sign reading: \u2018<em>NO RIFF RAFF<\/em>\u2019.
